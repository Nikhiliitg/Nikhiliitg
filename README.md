## About Me

I am a student engineer learning how **real-world ML and backend systems are designed,
built, and evaluated** beyond isolated models or scripts.

Through academic projects, personal systems, and a guided ML internship, I have worked
across the **full lifecycle of ML systems** — data ingestion, model training, evaluation,
and deployment — while actively learning about **scalability, latency, and system trade-offs**.

My long-term interest lies at the intersection of:
- Distributed backend systems
- ML system design and MLOps
- LLM-based retrieval and search systems

Currently preparing for **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and seeking opportunities to
contribute to open-source projects with strong engineering practices.

## Open Source & GSoC Focus

I am preparing for **Google Summer of Code** with a focus on:
- Backend-heavy open-source projects
- ML platforms, tooling, and infrastructure
- Learning through mentored, well-scoped contributions

I value:
- Clear documentation
- Small, reviewable pull requests
- Honest discussion of limitations and trade-offs

---

## Coursework

- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Big Data Processing
- MLOps
- Probability & Random Processes
- Generative AI

---

## What I’m Optimizing For

- Learning systems by building them end-to-end
- Understanding failures instead of hiding them
- Writing code others can read, review, and improve

If you’re working on **backend systems, ML infrastructure, or open-source tooling** and
are open to collaboration or feedback, I’d be glad to learn.
